# Binary-and-Gray-Code-Guessing-Game

  This gameâ€™s design is based on the combination of AutoCAD and an Arduino microcontroller. The game is a binary and gray code converter. The user had to guess the gray code or binary of the corresponding decimal number presented to him/her on the LCD display. The code included random number generator to randomize the decimal numbers and the number system. The game used a pushbutton user interface to identify 4-bit binary numbers. The game would wait for user input in order to start a round of the game, and then it would compare the input that the user provides and the correct answer to determine if the user won or lost. The case for the game was designed to meet the 10x8x6 inch specifications. It was first designed on SolidWorks and then it was built out of acrylic sheets.
